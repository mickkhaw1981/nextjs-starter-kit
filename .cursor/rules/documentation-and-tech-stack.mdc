## Documentation Usage
- Always consult the project's ***PRD.md ** file located at the project root for clear understanding of goals and features..
- Review all additional documentation files within the ** docs ** directory provided with the project.
If additional or updated documentation is required, use MCP servers (Brave Search, Puppeteer, FireCrawl) to locate official and current sources online.

## This Project's Tech Stack:
- Next.js 15
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- ShadCN UI components
- Framer Motion
- Storybook
- Prisma for database ORM
- Supabase for database

## Icons
- Prefer `lucide-react`; name icons in PascalCase.
- Custom icons in `src/components/icons`.

## User Interface (UI) and Styling
- **Never change or affect the UI unintentionally. Only alter UI components if explicitly instructed or clearly part of the assigned task.
- Use ShadCN UI and Radix components
- Use `npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>` to add new shadcn components. NEVER use `npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>` 
- Use Tailwind CSS (mobile-first, dark mode with dark:(class)). Extend brand tokens in `tailwind.config.ts`.

## Toast Notifications
- Use `sonner` toast component
- import { toast } from "sonner"
- toast("Event has been created.")

## Storybook
- Place stories in `src/stories` with `.stories.tsx` extension.
- One story file per component, matching component name.
- Use autodocs for automatic documentation.
- Include multiple variants and sizes in stories.
- Test interactive features with actions.
- Use relative imports from component directory.

## Technical Stack Compliance
- **Adhere strictly to the project's established technology stack.**
- Do not introduce new technologies or packages unless explicitly instructed and justified.
- You may suggest alternative technologies if beneficial, but never implement them without user approval.
