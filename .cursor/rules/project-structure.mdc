## Next.js Structure
- Use App Router in `src/app/`
- Default to Server Components where possible
- Assume we always design for mobile and web. Follow responsive design principles
- Implement efficient data fetching
- Implement error handling
- Use loading states
- Follow routing conventions
- Use absolute imports (@/ for src, ~/ for outside)
- Write clean, concise components

## File tree
- Project file tree can be found in [project-structure.md](mdc:docs/project-structure.md)

# File & Folder Names
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., VisaForm.tsx)
- Use camelCase for utility files, variables and function names (e.g., getUserData, isAuthenticated)
- Favor named exports for components and utilities
