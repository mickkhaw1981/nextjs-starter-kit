## Next.js Structure
- Use App Router in `src/app/`. Server components by default, `"use client"` for client logic.
- Project structure can be found in [project-structure.md](mdc:docs/project-structure.md)

# File & Folder Names
- Next.js routes in kebab-case (e.g. `app/dashboard/page.tsx`).
- Name in PascalCase under `src/components/`.
- Shared types in `src/lib/types.ts`.
- Sort imports (external → internal → sibling → styles).


#### Env Rules
- If you update environment variables, update the `.env.example` file
- All environment variables should go in `.env.local`
- Do not expose environment variables to the frontend
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for environment variables that need to be accessed from the frontend
- You may import environment variables in server actions and components by using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`
