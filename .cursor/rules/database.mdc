## Supabase (Postgres MCP Development Only)
- Always use the project-specific **Supabase MCP server** for database operations.
- Use structured relational SQL storage provided by Supabase. Avoid using raw 350N file storage for structured data unless explicitly required by schema design.
- Database operations are strictly for the development environment only.
- **Never delete or alter critical data without explicit confirmation.** Operations should be carefully controlled.
